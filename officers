 There are only four types of officer.
 First, there are the lazy, stupid ones. Leave them alone, they do no harmâ€¦
 Second, there are the hard-working, intelligent ones. They make excellent staff officers, ensuring that every detail is properly considered.
 Third, there are the hard-working, stupid ones. These people are a menace and must be fired at once. They create irrelevant work for everybody.
 Finally, there are the intelligent, lazy ones. They are suited for the highest office.
